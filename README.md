This project is meant to be an exercise in transfer learning. The original inspiration was to start with a pre-trained model that can be used to detect and scare off my cats when they are on my kitchen counter.

My ultimate goal is to fine tune an existing model to attempt to detect each of my pets by name rather than by species.
